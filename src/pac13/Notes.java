/*1.using super keyword we can access the members of parent class
   Using super keyword is use only when inheritance is happen
   2.using super keywrod we can access static and non sttic member
	3.super keyword can not be use inside static context
	
	4.using super keyword we can call constructor of parent class
	but then we should use super keyword in child class constuctor.
	it should be very fist statement 
	
	5.if we don't keep super keyword inside child class constructor then compiler 
	will automatically place the super keyword such that it can call only no args
	constructor of parent class
	
	 6.if you don't create child class constructor with out arguments then compiler
	will keep automatically no args constructor with super keyword
	
	7.if in the parent class there is only constructor with argument then 
	as a programmer we should explicitly write super keyword  in constructor
	
	//super keyword is not automatically kept where there are only constructor
	//with arguments in parent class.where as super will be placed automatically
	//when in that parent class there is a constructo with no arguments.
	
	//we can not use this keyword and super keyword in the same constructor.
	//to call another constuctor as eiter of the statemennts becomes 2nd staments
	//then we will get error
	
	//if your child class constructor consist of this keywords then 
	//in that constructor 
	//super keyword will not be placed automatically.
